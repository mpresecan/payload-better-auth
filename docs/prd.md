# Payload Stack Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1. Goals
* A developer will be able to initialize a new project and have a fully functional user authentication system running in under 10 minutes.
* The boilerplate must include a pre-configured Stripe integration that supports at least two subscription tiers.
* It must provide a basic, styleable marketing page and a connected user dashboard out of the box.
* A comprehensive user and account management interface must be implemented.

### 1.2. Background Context
Payload Stack is designed to be the fastest and most effective starting point for building modern SaaS applications. It addresses the need for a versatile, easily configurable boilerplate that integrates best practices in SaaS architecture, allowing development teams to get their unique solutions market-ready in a fraction of the time. The ultimate vision is for Payload Stack to become the go-to solution for rapid SaaS development.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. Functional Requirements (FR)
* **FR1: Core Authentication System:** The system must provide a comprehensive and modular authentication experience, featuring:
    * **FR1.1 (Login Methods):** Support for multiple login methods including standard Email/Password, Username, Phone Number with OTP, and Google Social Login.
    * **FR1.2 (Passwordless):** Passwordless login options must be available via "Magic Links" sent to the user's email and one-time codes (Email OTP).
    * **FR1.3 (Passkeys):** Support for modern, secure authentication using Passkeys must be included.
    * **FR1.4 (Multi-Factor):** A complete Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) flow using authenticator apps must be provided.
    * **FR1.5 (Account Management):** Users must be able to securely change their email and delete their own account, with email verification for both actions. Account linking between different providers (e.g., Google and Email/Password) must be supported.
* **FR2:** The system must support multi-tenancy for organizations/teams using the Payload multi-tenancy plugin, including inviting members to an organization.
* **FR3:** The system must provide Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) as managed by Payload CMS, including a pre-defined 'admin' role.
* **FR4:** The system must support flexible database configurations as enabled by Payload CMS.
* **FR5:** The system must integrate with Stripe for subscription and billing management.
* **FR6:** The system must include two dashboards: a dedicated user dashboard and the standard Payload CMS admin dashboard.
* **FR7:** The system must expose a secure API layer managed by Payload CMS and "better-auth".
* **FR8:** The system must include a boilerplate for generating basic GDPR-related content.
* **FR9:** The system must handle transactional emails via a default Resend integration.
* **FR10:** The system's UI must be built using the ShadCN component library.
* **FR11:** The system must provide a simple marketing page with sign-up/sign-in functionality.

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
* **NFR1:** The boilerplate must be infrastructure-agnostic, allowing deployment to various hosting environments.
* **NFR2:** Key third-party integrations (e.g., Email, Payments) must be modular and easily configurable to allow developers to swap providers.
* **NFR3:** The initial developer setup and configuration process, from cloning the repo to having a running instance, should be achievable in under 15 minutes.
* **NFR4 (Configurability):** All authentication features (social logins, MFA, passwordless methods, etc.) must be individually configurable. A developer using the boilerplate must be able to easily enable or disable any specific authentication method through a central configuration file without touching the core logic.
* **NFR5 (LLM-Friendly Documentation):** Every module and core feature must be accompanied by dedicated, machine-readable documentation that clearly explains its purpose, configuration options, and API. This documentation is intended to be consumed by Large Language Models to facilitate rapid, "vibe-coding" style development.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### 3.1. Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Configuration-Driven UI:** The authentication pages (Login, Sign-up) must dynamically render options and input fields based *only* on what is enabled in the central `betterAuthOptions` configuration file. Helper utilities will be created to read this config and display UI components conditionally.
* **Context-Aware Login Flow:** The initial login/sign-up screen will be minimalist, presenting only an email input field. After a user enters their email and proceeds, the system will check the account's status and dynamically present the next logical step (e.g., show a password field, an OTP input, or a "check your email for a magic link" message).

### 3.2. Core Screens and Views
* **Marketing Page:** A simple page leading to the authentication flow.
* **Authentication Screen(s):** A single, dynamic page that handles all login and sign-up flows as described above.
* **User Dashboard:** The main dashboard for a logged-in user.
* **Admin Dashboard:** The standard Payload CMS dashboard for administration.

## 4. Technical Assumptions

### 4.1. Core Technology & Integrations
* **Core Framework:** Next.js will be used as the full-stack application framework. Payload CMS will be integrated as the foundational backend and admin interface.
* **Authentication:** Must be handled by the `better-auth` library.
* **UI Components:** The frontend will be built using ShadCN.
* **Payments:** Stripe is the required integration for billing and subscriptions.
* **Email:** Resend is the default integration for transactional emails.

### 4.2. Configuration
* **Central `siteConfig` File:** A central configuration file (e.g., `siteConfig.ts`) will exist to manage site-wide variables like name, description, logo, URLs, and support email.
* **Modular Integrations:** Key integrations (Email, Payments) must be architected in a modular way, allowing developers to swap providers by changing configuration.

### 4.3. Key Architectural Decisions
* **Repository Structure: Monorepo.** The entire application stack (frontend, backend logic, etc.) will be contained within a single repository, as is standard for an integrated Next.js project.
* **Service Architecture: Monolith.** The application will be a well-structured monolith, leveraging the integrated nature of the Next.js framework.
