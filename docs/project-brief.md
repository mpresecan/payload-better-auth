# Project Brief: Payload Stack

### Introduction / Problem Statement
Payload Stack is designed to be the fastest and most effective starting point for building modern SaaS applications. It addresses the need for a versatile, easily configurable boilerplate that integrates best practices in SaaS architecture, allowing development teams to get their unique solutions market-ready in a fraction of the time.

### Vision & Goals
* **Vision:** To become the go-to solution for rapid SaaS development.
* **Primary Goals (MVP):**
    * A developer can initialize a new project and have a fully functional user authentication system running in under 10 minutes.
    * The boilerplate must include a pre-configured Stripe integration that supports at least two subscription tiers.
    * It must provide a basic, styleable marketing page and a connected user dashboard out of the box.
    * A comprehensive user and account management interface must be implemented.
* **Success Metrics:**
    * Achieve 10,000 GitHub stars within the first six months of launch.

### Target Audience / Users
The primary users for Payload Stack include:
* Indie hackers and solo developers
* Solopreneurs
* Early-stage startups with small teams
* Freelancers building projects for clients
* Larger companies looking to standardize their stack

### Key Features / Scope (High-Level Ideas for MVP)
* **Authentication:** Implemented via the "better-auth" package for Payload CMS.
* **Multi-Tenancy:** Handled by the Payload multi-tenancy plugin to support organizations/teams.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Managed directly through Payload CMS's built-in capabilities.
* **Database Flexibility:** Flexible DB integration as handled by Payload CMS.
* **Subscriptions & Billing:** Direct integration with Stripe for payment processing.
* **Dashboards:** A dual-dashboard system featuring a dedicated user dashboard and the standard Payload CMS admin dashboard.
* **API Layer:** Secure API provided by Payload CMS and the "better-auth" package.
* **Compliance:** A boilerplate for generating basic GDPR-related content.
* **Email Notifications:** Integration with Resend, designed with a modular approach to easily support other email providers.
* **UI Components:** A foundational UI built upon ShadCN.
* **Marketing Page:** A simple, clean marketing page that directs users to the sign-up/sign-in flow.

### Post MVP Features / Scope and Ideas
* **User Feedback & Feature Management System:** A dedicated system to allow developers using the boilerplate to collect, monitor, and act on feedback from their own users regarding feature requests and service improvements.

### Known Technical Constraints or Preferences
* **Architectural Principle:** The boilerplate must be infrastructure-agnostic, allowing deployment to various hosting environments.
* **Configurable Integrations:** Key integrations (like Stripe, Resend) must be designed in a modular way, making it easy for developers to swap them out for other providers with minimal code changes.
* **Authentication:** Must use the "better-auth" package.
* **Multi-Tenancy:** Must use the Payload multi-tenancy plugin.
* **UI:** Built upon ShadCN.
* **Billing:** Stripe integration is mandatory for the initial version.
